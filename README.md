# PhonGen: Phonemic Generalization

**PhonGen** (Phonemic Generalization) is a research project designed to investigate how learners generalize phonemic contrasts based on phonological features. Specifically, it examines whether learning contrasts involving multiple features leads to:

- **Feature-based generalization** (extending knowledge of individual features), or  
- **Conjunctive generalization** (extending only the specific combination of features present in the learned contrasts).

This project aims to shed light on the underlying representational mechanisms used in phonemic learning, with implications for phonological theory, computational modeling, and cognitive science.
